# Use a CEN to interconnect network instances {#concept_1546434 .concept}

This topic describes how to use a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) to interconnect network instances, such as VPCs, VBRs associated with on-premises data centers, and CCNs to which local branches or headquarters is added. The procedure varies depending on the specific regions and accounts.

## Interconnect network instances under the same account in the same region {#section_rw2_jfn_rwf .section}

To interconnect network instances under the same account in the same region, you need to attach these network instances to a CEN instance.

## Interconnect network instances under the same account in different regions {#section_7to_2q9_jcv .section}

To interconnect network instances under the same account in different regions, you need to attach these network instances to a CEN instance and set a cross-region connection bandwidth.
