# Tutorial overview {#concept_ppf_c3b_tdb .concept}

Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) allows you to create a global network for rapidly building a distributed business system with a hybrid cloud computing solution. CEN enables you to build an enterprise-class interconnected network. The tutorials in this section show you how to use CEN to create a global network in different scenarios.

## Interconnection in the same region using the same account {#section_om2_33b_tdb .section}

To connect VPCs and VBRs in the same region using the same account, complete these steps:

1.  Create a CEN instance.
2.  Attached VPCs and VBRs to the CEN instance.

    For more information, see [Connect networks in the same region using the same account](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Connect networks in the same region using the same account.md#).


## Cross-region interconnection using the same account {#section_qm2_33b_tdb .section}

To connect VPCs and VBRs in different regions using the same account, complete these steps:

1.  Create a CEN instance.
2.  Attach VPCs and VBRs to the CEN instance.
3.  Buy a bandwidth package.
4.  Set the cross-region interconnection bandwidth.

    For more information, see [Connect network instances in different regions using same account](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Connect network instances in different regions using same account.md#).


## Cross-account interconnection in the same region {#section_tm2_33b_tdb .section}

To connect VPCs and VBRs in the same region using different accounts, complete these steps:

1.  Account A creates a CEN instance.
2.  Account B authorizes Account A to attach the network resource of account B.
3.  Account A attaches the network in Account B \(VPCs and VBRs\) to the CEN instance.

    For more information, see [Connect networks in the same region using the different account](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Connect networks in the same region using the different account.md#).


## Cross-region interconnection using different accounts {#section_wm2_33b_tdb .section}

To connect VPCs and VBRs in different regions using different accounts, complete these steps:

1.  Account A creates an instance of the cloud enterprise network.
2.  Account A creates a CEN instance.
3.  Account B authorizes Account A to attach the network resource of Account B.
4.  Account A buys a bandwidth package.
5.  Account A sets up cross-regional communication bandwidth.
