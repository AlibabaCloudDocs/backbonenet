# Advanced configurations {#concept_1563897 .concept}

This topic describes the advanced configurations of a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\). You can use the advanced configurations to manage your private networks.

A CEN provides the following advanced configurations:

-   Access to cloud services

    Network instances attached to a CEN instance can access the PrivateZone service through the CEN instance. For more information, see [PrivateZone overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Access to cloud services/PrivateZone overview.md#).

-   Route map

    By using the route map function, you can filter route information and modify route attributes to manage the communication between network instances attached to a CEN instance. For more information, see [Route map overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Routing policies/Route map overview.md#).

-   High availability

    You can establish high-availability hybrid cloud networks by using health check, physical connections, VPN Gateways, and other Alibaba Cloud products.
