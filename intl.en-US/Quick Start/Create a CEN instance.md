# Create a CEN instance {#task_1563467 .task}

Before you use Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) for intranet communication, you must create a CEN instance. When you create a CEN instance, you can directly attach networks under the same account to the CEN instance.

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  On the Instances page, click **Create CEN instance**.
3.  In the Create a CEN instance dialog box, configure the CEN instance according to the following information: 
    1.  Enter a name for the CEN instance to be created. The name must be 2 to 128 characters in length and can contain letters, numbers, underscores \(\_\), and hyphens \(-\). It must start with an English letter.
    2.  Enter a description for the CEN instance. The description must be 2 to 256 characters in length and cannot start with `http://` or `https://`.
    3.  Attach a network under the same account to the CEN instance. When you create a CEN instance, you can directly attach a network under the same account to the CEN instance. The network can be a VPC, a Virtual Border Router \(VBR\), or a Cloud Connect Network \(CCN\). The networks attached to the CEN instance can communicate with each other through the intranet.

        **Note:** Make sure that the network to attach is not attached to other CEN instances.

    4.  Click **OK**.
