# Cross-region interconnection bandwidth {#concept_ky4_cmh_tdb .concept}

To connect networks in different regions, you must set cross-region interconnection bandwidth after buying a bandwidth package. The total bandwidth set for all the interconnected regions of a bandwidth package cannot exceed the bandwidth of the bandwidth package. By default, 1 Kbps bandwidth is provided for connectivity test. To run normal business, you must buy a bandwidth package and set a proper interconnection bandwidth.

For example, a CEN instance is bound to a bandwidth package of 20 Mbps and  the interconnection areas are Mainland China and North America. You can set the cross-region interconnection bandwidth between US West 1 and China East 1, China East 2, China South 1, and so on. However, the total bandwidth set for all the interconnected regions cannot exceed 20  Mbps.
