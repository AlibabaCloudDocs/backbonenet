# Benefits {#concept_avz_fpz_sdb .concept}

## Worldwide connection {#section_hzf_xpz_sdb .section}

Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) creates a global network that connects Alibaba Cloud resources around the world and the resources that have access to Alibaba Cloud. CEN validates the IP address ranges of the connected networks and ensures that the IP address ranges do not conflict with each other. Additionally, CEN automatically realizes multi-node adaptive route forwarding and distribution through controllers. You can have rapidly converged routes without the need to manually configure routes.

## Low latency and high speed {#section_izf_xpz_sdb .section}

CEN provides low-latency and high-speed network transmission. The maximum local communication rate can reach the port forwarding rate of a device. In the case of global network communication, the overall latency of CEN is greatly improved compared with the latency of the Internet.

## Nearby access and shortest path {#section_jzf_xpz_sdb .section}

CEN deploys multiple access points in more than 60 regions around the world to facilitate global access to Alibaba Cloud. CEN uses the shortest path to connect on-premises data centers and Alibaba Cloud network resources.

## Redundancy and disaster recovery {#section_kzf_xpz_sdb .section}

CEN features high availability and network redundancy. There are at least four redundant links between any two access points. If a link fails, CEN can ensure normal running of your service without network jitter or interruptions.

## Systematic management {#section_lzf_xpz_sdb .section}

Network monitoring is systematic. CEN can automatically detect any route conflicts caused by system changes and ensure the stability of the network.
