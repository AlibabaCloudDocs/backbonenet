# Scenarios {#concept_l4r_4b1_tdb .concept}

You can use Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) to connect network resources across the globe.

## Network interconnection in the same region {#section_mtv_5b1_tdb .section}

Only two steps are required to connect all the attached Virtual Private Cloud \(VPCs\) and Virtual Border Routers \(VBRs\) that belong to the same region and the same account. First, create a CEN instance. Then, attach the networks \(VPCs and VBRs\) to the CEN instance.

## Network interconnection in different regions {#section_phc_bc1_tdb .section}

You can use CEN to connect networks in any regions. For example, you can create a CEN instance to connect VPCs in the Asia-Pacific and North America areas. First, create a CEN instance and attach the networks \(VPCs and VBRs\) to be connected to the CEN instance. Then, purchase a bandwidth package and set up cross-region bandwidth.
