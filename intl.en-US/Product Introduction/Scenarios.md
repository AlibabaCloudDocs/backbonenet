# Scenarios {#concept_l4r_4b1_tdb .concept}

You can use the Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) to achieve the global network interconnection.

## Network interconnection in the same region {#section_mtv_5b1_tdb .section}

Only two steps are required to achieve the interconnection of all the attached Virtual Private Cloud \(VPCs\) and Virtual Border Routers \(VBRs\) in the same region of the same account. Firstly, create a CEN instance, and then attach the networks \(VPCs and VBRs\) to connect to the instance.

## Network interconnection in different regions {#section_phc_bc1_tdb .section}

You can use CEN to achieve the interconnection of networks in any regions. For example, you can create a CEN instance to connect VPCs in the Asia-Pacific and North America areas.Â  Firstly, create a CEN instance and attach the networks \(VPCs and VBRs\) to connect to the instance, and then purchase a bandwidth package and set up cross-region bandwidth.
