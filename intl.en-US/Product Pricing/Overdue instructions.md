# Overdue instructions {#concept_av3_d5w_5db .concept}

The Cloud Enterprise Network service will not be suspended immediately when a bill is overdue. Renew your service on time to reduce the impact on your business.

## Stop instances {#section_kw1_t5w_5db .section}

The instance is locked and the service is stopped when a bill is overdue but does not exceed 15 days. In this case, you cannot perform any operation on the instance, and the instance no longer forwards any traffic. However, the related configurations of the instance are reserved. If you recharge your overdue payment within 15 days of the service being stopped, the instance is automatically restarted.

## Release instances {#section_qmv_t5w_5db .section}

If you do not recharge your overdue bill 15 days after the service is stopped, the instance is released. The instance configurations are also deleted, and cannot be restored.
