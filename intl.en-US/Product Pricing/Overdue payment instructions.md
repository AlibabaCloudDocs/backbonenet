# Overdue payment instructions {#concept_av3_d5w_5db .concept}

The Cloud Enterprise Network service will not be suspended immediately when a bandwidth package bill is overdue. Renew your bandwidth package on time to reduce the impact on your business.

## Stop bandwidth packages {#section_kw1_t5w_5db .section}

When a bill is overdue but does not exceed 15 days, the corresponding bandwidth package is stopped. No traffic is forwarded, but related configurations are reserved. If you pay the bill within 15 days after the service is stopped, the bandwidth package is automatically restarted.

## Release bandwidth packages {#section_qmv_t5w_5db .section}

If you do not pay your overdue bill 15 days after the service is stopped, the bandwidth package is released. Related configurations are also deleted, and cannot be restored.
