# Billing method {#concept_s3j_kgb_tdb .concept}

Whether network connections are charged depends on the regions of the connected networks, not the accounts to which the connected networks belong. Connections between two networks in the same region are free of charge and do not require any bandwidth package. Connections between networks in different regions are charged and you must buy a bandwidth package for these connections.

## Billing method of bandwidth packages {#section_j11_pgb_tdb .section}

Each bandwidth package is billed based on the bandwidth, and prices for different areas are different.

-   Billing item: bandwidth fee. The minimum bandwidth is 2 Mbit/s.
-   Billing method: Subscription

    Subscription bandwidth packages cannot be deleted and will be automatically released after expiration.

-   Billing cycle: month

## Bandwidth package type {#section_lwt_sgb_tdb .section}

When you purchase a bandwidth package, you must specify the connected areas. Each area contains one or more regions. Based on the connected areas, bandwidth packages are divided into the following three types, and the price of each type is different. Bandwidth packages that belong to the same type but with different connected regions are charged in different prices.

**Note:** Bandwidth packages are required only when cross-region communication is needed. No bandwidth package is required for the communication in the same region.
