# Disassociate a bandwidth package from a CEN instance {#task_1780388 .task}

This topic describes how to disassociate a bandwidth package from a CEN instance. After you disassociate a bandwidth package from a CEN instance, you can associate the bandwidth package with another CEN instance.

The cross-region interconnection bandwidth is deleted from the bandwidth package. For more information, see [Delete a cross-region connection bandwidth](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Manage cross-region connection bandwidth/Delete a cross-region connection bandwidth.md#).

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  On the Instances page, find the target CEN instance, and then click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.
3.  On the CEN page, click the **Bandwidth Packages** tab, find the target bandwidth package, and then click **Unbind** in the **Actions** column.
4.  In the Unbind Bandwidth Package dialog box, click **OK**. After the bandwidth package is disassociated from the CEN instance, the bandwidth package is still in the available state and incurs fees. To delete the bandwidth package, open a ticket.
