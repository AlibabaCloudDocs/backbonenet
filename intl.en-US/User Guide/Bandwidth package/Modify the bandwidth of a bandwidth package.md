# Modify the bandwidth of a bandwidth package {#task_1780494 .task}

This topic describes how to modify the bandwidth of a bandwidth package that is associated with a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) instance. After you modify the bandwidth of a bandwidth package, the new bandwidth takes effect immediately.

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  On the Instances page, find the target CEN instance, and then click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.
3.  On the CEN page, click the **Bandwidth Packages** tab, find the target bandwidth package, and then click **Downgrade** or **Upgrade** in the **Bandwidth** column. 

    **Note:** Cross-border bandwidth packages \(from Mainland China to areas outside Mainland China\) do not support bandwidth downgrades. 

4.  In the Configuration Upgrade area, select a new bandwidth and click **Pay**.
