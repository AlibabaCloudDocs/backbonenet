# Associate a bandwidth package with a CEN instance {#task_1780173 .task}

This topic describes how to associate a bandwidth package with a CEN instance. After you purchase a bandwidth package, you must associate it with a CEN instance so that you can configure cross-region interconnection bandwidth.

The CEN instance is not associated with any bandwidth package between two regions in the same area or in two different areas. For example, if a CEN instance is associated with a bandwidth package between two regions in the Mainland China area, you cannot associate the CEN instance to a bandwidth package between another two regions in the Mainland China area. However, you can associate the CEN instance with a bandwidth package between Mainland China to North America.

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  On the Instances page, find the target CEN instance, and then click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.
3.  On the CEN page, click **Bandwidth Packages** tab, find the target bandwidth package, and then click **Bind** in the **Actions** column.
4.  In the Bind Bandwidth Package dialog box, click **OK**.
