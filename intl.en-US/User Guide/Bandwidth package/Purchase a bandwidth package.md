# Purchase a bandwidth package {#task_1681280 .task}

This topic describes how to purchase a bandwidth package for a CEN instance. After you purchase a bandwidth package, you can set a cross-region bandwidth value to allow mutual access between network instances in different regions. Mutual access between two instances in the same region does not require a bandwidth package.

The bandwidth package of a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) instance consists of an interconnection bandwidth and interconnected areas. When you purchase a bandwidth package, you must specify the areas to be interconnected. An area consists of one or more Alibaba Cloud regions.

The following table describes the areas and their respective regions.

|Area|Included regions|

|Mainland China|China \(Qingdao\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Zhangjiakou\), China \(Shenzhen\), China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shanghai\), China \(Hohhot\)|

|Asia Pacific|China \(Hong Kong\), Singapore, Malaysia \(Kuala Lumpur\), Japan \(Tokyo\), India \(Mumbai\), Indonesia \(Jakarta\)|
