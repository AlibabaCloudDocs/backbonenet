# Start a flow log {#task_895463 .task}

This topic describes how to start a flow log that is in the **Disabled** state. You must start a flow log if you want to record the cross-region traffic data of networks associated with a Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\) instance.

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Flow Logs**.
3.  Select the region of the target flow log.
4.  On the CEN page, find the target flow log and click **Start** in the **Actions** column. After the flow log is started, the status of the flow log changes to **Enabled**.
