# View CEN routes {#concept_pst_dmh_tdb .concept}

CEN automatically realizes the multi-node adaptive routing forwarding and distribution. The adaptive routing process improves the network performance.

## View CEN routes on the CEN console {#section_xrg_dxn_tdb .section}

You can view routes of networks in other regions learned by the CEN instance. For example, a CEN instance has attached a VPC in China North 1 \(Qingdao\) and another VPC in China North 2 \(Beijing\). You can follow these steps to view routes learned from the VPC in China North 1.

To view the learned routes, complete these steps:

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://cen.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  Click the ID of the target CEN instance.
3.  Click **Routes** and select the region to query.

    Descriptions of fields in a route entry are as follows:

    |Field|Description|
    |:----|:----------|
    |**Region**|The region of the routes to query.|
    |**CIDR Block**|The learned CIDR block.|
    |**Destination Region**|The region of the learned CIDR block.|
    |**Destination Network ID**|The network to which the destination CIDR block belongs.|
