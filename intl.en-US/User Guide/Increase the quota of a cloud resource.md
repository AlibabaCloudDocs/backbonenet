# Increase the quota of a cloud resource {#task_264721 .task}

This topic describes how to increase the quota of a cloud resource in the CEN console. If the remaining quota of a cloud resource is insufficient, you can apply for a quota increase.

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Quotas**. The resource usage of the CENs under your account is displayed.
3.  Click **Apply** in the **Actions** column, and then set the following parameters in the displayed dialog box: 

    -   **Quantity for Application**: the resource quota that you need. The quota you apply for must be greater than the current quota. For information about the default resource limits of a CEN, see [LimitsÂ ](../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md#).
    -   **Reason for Application**: your reason for applying for a quota increase. We recommend that you provide details about your specific scenarios.
    -   **Email**: your email address.
4.  Click **OK**. The system then determines whether the quota increase application is reasonable.

    -   If the request is unreasonable, the status of the application is **Rejected**.
    -   If the request is reasonable, the status of the application is **Approved**, and the quota is automatically increased to the quota that you applied for.
    To view the historical quota applications of a cloud resource, click **Application History** in the **Application History** column.
