# Delete a CEN instance {#task_1680986 .task}

This topic describes how to delete a CEN instance. After you delete a CEN instance, network instances cannot be attached to the CEN instance.

No bandwidth package or network instance exists under the CEN instance.

-   If a network instance is attached to the CEN instance, detach the network instance first. For more information, see [Detach a network instance from a CEN instance](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Manage networks/Detach a network instance from a CEN instance.md#).
-   If a bandwidth package is associated with the CEN instance, disassociate the bandwidth package first. For more information, see [Disassociate a bandwidth package from a CEN instance](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Bandwidth package/Disassociate a bandwidth package from a CEN instance.md#).

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  On the Instances page, find the target CEN instance, and then click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.
3.  In the Delete Cloud Enterprise Network Instance dialog box, click **OK**.
