# Modify a route map {#task_1495513 .task}

This topic describes how to modify a route map of a CEN instance. After you create a route map, you can modify its priority, description, transmit direction, match condition, match mode, and preference.

You cannot modify the default route map whose priority is greater than 1000. However, you can add a custom route map to overwrite the default route map.

1.  Log on to the [CEN console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cbn).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Instances**.
3.  On the Instances page, find the target CEN instance, and then click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.
4.  On the CEN page, click the **Route Maps** tab, find the target route map, and then click **Modify** in the **Actions** column.
5.  On the Modify Route Map page, modify the priority, description, transmit direction, match condition, match mode, and preference as needed, and then click **OK**.
