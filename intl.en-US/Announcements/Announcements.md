# Announcements {#concept_qkg_cnv_m2b .concept}

The following limitations have been added to Cloud Enterprise Network \(CEN\), and will take effect from August 1, 2018:

-   Local data centers connected by VBRs that are attached to CEN cannot learn routing entries from each other or communicate with each other.
-   By default, a VBR that is connected to a H3C switch \(H3C6855\) cannot be attached to CEN. If you require VBR intercommunication or a connection with a H3C switch, open a ticket.
